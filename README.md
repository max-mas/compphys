Coursework for the Computational Physics Course given at Stockholm University in Spring of 2024.

Projects are added in a subfolder each as they're published / completed:

- Alpha decay: Quantum tunnelling simulation using a piecewise constant potential.
- Earth temperature: Estimation of Earth's temperature using radiation balance in a discretised air column.

Each project contains the code for the respective task, visualisation of the results and a written report.
